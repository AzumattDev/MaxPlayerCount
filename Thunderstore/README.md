> ## Installation Instructions
***You must have BepInEx installed correctly! I can not stress this enough.***
`Only required to be installed on the server.`

1. Download the latest version of BepInEx from [here](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2. Make sure it's installed correctly on the server.
3. Put the DLL into your BepInEx\plugins folder.
4. Launch the server. 
5. Change the player limit found in the configuration file generated in `BepInEx/config` called `Azumatt.MaxPlayerCount.cfg` to the desired amount of players.
6. You should now be able to go past the limit of 10 players or to the value you have specified.

`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`
