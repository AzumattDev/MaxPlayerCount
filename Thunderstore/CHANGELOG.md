| **1.2.1** | - Fix ref for Steamworks to new one. Makes compatible with 0.217.46 as they officially removed the old assembly.                                                                                                                                 |
| **1.2.0** | - Fix an issue in Playfab IL patch per the playfab developer recommendation. This accounts for the dedicated server acting as a player in the playfab lobby. Meaning, when changing the value I should actually be returning the config value +1 |
| **1.1.1** | - Patch an additional method for Crossplay. Might fix some of the issues people are having.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **1.1.0** | - Update to work with Crossplay. Didn't really have much people to test it, but should work fine.<br/> - Alter the default value to be double vanilla. It's now at 20 by default.                                                                |
